# Find That Thing

Find That Thing is an app available for iOS and Android that helps you find missing items. It uses voice recognition to create a database of your item's name and location, which makes it incredibly easy to add items and search for them. If you don't know the exact name of your item, you can simply open a list of all of the stored items to view them all or delete unnecessary items.
